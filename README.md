Fork of Sprinkling System Control Program for the Raspberry Pi

now i know what the Fork button does :-)... but seriously, I'm hoping to add features and perhaps create a version of the code that doesn't try to constrain itself to be compatible with the original constrained memory footprint of the original.  
This will probably take a while.  I just ordered the sprinkler board from Ray's Hobby, and a Pi for it.   My previous and ongoing Pi project is a control system (in C) for an aquarium - heaters, lights, feeders, nitrate filter, webcam, temp sensors, email alarms, etc.  

Contributions and suggestions welcome.
